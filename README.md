# Data-Preprocessing-Tools
Before we build any Machine Learning Model the data on which the model will trin itself has to be pre-processed so as to take care of missing values, anomalies in the data etc. .So this tool kit does the same, gives the mean of the values to the missing value column, encodes the string data type in the dataset to a array of 0s and 1s, and then adds feature scaling to the data.
